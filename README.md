# smartchain
A simple example ethereum-like smart-contract blockchain

Developed from original Udemy course: Ethereum Tutorial: Build Ethereum from Scratch by David Katz

Etheremm-inspired algorithm:

1. Calculate a block target hash
2. Try to find an "underTargetHash" lower than the block target hash

    underTargetHash consists of:
    * timestamp
    * number
    * beneficiary
    * difficulty
    * nonce
